title: Welcome to my blog

# I have a blog now!

I've had this idea for a while, and I finally got it to work. This is my blog, where I'll be posting about various topics that interest me. Feel free to request stuff.

I'll do my best to update somewhat regularly, but who knows if I'll actually do that.

This blog is stored in a separate repository from my main website, which you can find, just for navigation purposes. The link back to the main website is below.

## Navigation
<table class="nav-table">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td><a href="/">Website Home</a></td>
			<td><a href="{{ '/tags/' | relative_url }}">View all tags</a></td>
			<td><a href="{{ '/posts/' | relative_url }}">View all posts</a></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><a href="{{ '/feed.xml' | relative_url }}">RSS</a></td>
			<td><a href="{{ '/contact/' | relative_url }}">Contact</a></td>

		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
