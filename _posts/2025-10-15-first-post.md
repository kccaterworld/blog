## I guess I'm a blogger now?

I decided to start a blog mostly just for the fun of it, and for the chance to share my random thoughts with all of you. This entire thing is probably going to be a mix of short rants, philosophical essays, and portfolio updates. To be honest, I'm not coming into this with high expectations, but I think it will be a fun experiment.

I guess we'll see where this goes. Maybe it will end up a graveyard of my ramblings, or it might actually turn into something. This one is pretty short, since there's not much to say. Hopefully, I'll have more interesting content in the future.
